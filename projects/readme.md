# Go projects

##This is just some doodles in Golang.

### maze-generator.go

This is a go implementation of the generator as shown by Dan Shiffman on the Coding Train. This doesn't have any graphics (I'm still looking for a Go graphics library in the style/spirit of p5.js/processing), but it's still orders of magnitude faster than in python or javascript. (Go rules)

### coffee.go

This file simulates a coffee shop, where workers have a finite amount of equipment (milk steamer, coffee grider, espresso machine) and a diminishing amount of resources (milk and coffee beans). It's loosely based on a talk by Sameer Ajmani at dotGo, where different models of concurrency were discussed in terms of a coffee shop.
