### maze-generator.go

This is a go implementation of the generator as shown by Dan Shiffman on the Coding Train. This doesn't have any graphics (I'm still looking for a Go graphics library in the style/spirit of p5.js/processing), but it's still orders of magnitude faster than in python or javascript. (Go rules)
